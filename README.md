# Action-Bidding

Action Bidding is an solo project where i want to create an auction website, and play around with styles and techniques.

The whole point of this project is to show that i can make a project with features like: Fetching data with API, and display it on the webpage.
People with Noroff authorization emails and their passwords can register, login, have an profile page, upload auctions to the API, bid and so.
